- Selectable features are features which the customer selects one from many available choices.
- For example, a shirt may be available in White, Blue, Green, Yellow, Pink.
  These colors would be selectable features of the variant product shirt, and the customer would be prompted to choose a color.
- Each color, though, would be a standard feature of the physical product.
  Thus, White would be a selectable feature of the virtual product 'shirt' but a standard feature of 'white shirt.'
