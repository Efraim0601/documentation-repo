- A product catalog is used to group many product categories together and forms an intermediate step in the organization between products, categories, and stores.
- The product catalog can be used to define a common look and feel for all categories in this catalog and specify the way different categories will behave.
- For example, it is very useful for stores which sell products from different manufacturer or completely different product types that require differing presentations to the customer.

- **Sequence from a Store to the Products
- Although the process sequence through the tabs discussed below does not correspond with the tab layout within the Catalog Manager, the progression of the steps is intentional.
- <ol>
  <li>Promotions and Price Rules cannot exist without Products.</li>
  <li>Products are usually so numerous that you wish to divide them into Categories and distinguish them by their Features.</li>
  <li>Categories are then the major sections of your Catalogs.</li>
  <li>And Catalogs must be associated with their related Stores.</li>
  <li>Therefore, when setting up your business, you need to start with the Store.</li>
  </ol>
- All of these details are handled within the Catalog Manager.
