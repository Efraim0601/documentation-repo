- The Bill of Materials is the list of raw materials or list of ingredients required to make our manufactured product.
- When a product is created and it will be manufactured, we need to define the relationship between the product and its raw materials. This is done using the BOM.
- For configurable product, or product with feature, itâ€™s possible to define some "Manufacturing Rules" to have a BOM which that adjust according to the options / feature chosen.
