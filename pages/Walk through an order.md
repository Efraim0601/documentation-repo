- Let’s assume that our phantom customer, Sherry Shopper, has logged in, selected the Demo Catalog, and is ready to order. We will now follow her through the ordering process.
-
- **1. From previous orders, a click on the Order History link**
  Shopper repeats previous Order Items by calling [Order History]. Click on [view] to select
  A complete order detail is shown.
  Clearly still within the ecommerce website, here the shopper sees details of the previous order. She has options to [Add All to Cart], [Add Checked to Cart] or request an auto-ship [Send me this every month].
  By checking on the item she wants to re-order, then clicking on [Add Checked to Cart], the item (in the same quantity as before) is added to her shopping cart. The screen will not clear out the earlier order, however, until she selects another process for finding her items. This gives her time to consider possibly re-ordering another item from the same list.
- **2. with Quick Add screen**
  Now Sherry can select from the drop-down screen to find a different Quick Add screen, she can add all of the items on this screen, or she can do what she wants, directly enter quantity for each she want.
  If she elects to click on the link to the Giant Widget, the configuration screen appear, to be able to choose among the variants.
  Sherry has choosen Silver over Black in the 4-Wheel version and can now click to [Add to Cart] (or to the [Add to Shopping List] link).
- **3. Final Choices**
  For her last two items, Sherry chose a His/Her Gizmo (GZ-9290) from the list of Quick Reorder items in the left-hand panel. Note how each time an item is selected, the display of that item is removed from the panel. Finally, on impulse, she added a Round Gizmo from the items listed under 'You might be interested in these as well:' You can see all these purchases now reflected in the Cart Summary.
  Four Items were selected; four other were added by the system at no cost as promos.
- **4. View Cart**
  When [View Cart] is selected, all details of the order-in-progress are displayed to the shopper. She can change quantities, remove selected items, or even add more products as desired.
	- a. First, note how even at this point of viewing the cart, there is an option to quick add another product! From here, the customer can recalculate her cart or continue shopping (which returns her to the previous screen), or proceed with Checkout.
	- b. Second, there are various promotional messages around this screen to encourage further shopping.
	- c. Finally, many primary links are available. Notice that the shopper can go into her Profile, she can view established Shopping Lists that she might have created before, she can look at her own Shopping History, etc.
- **5. Proceed to Checkout**
	- a.  Confirm the shipping address, using the radio buttons. If a tax exemption applies, enter details.
	- b.  Shipping address and details, confirm the shipping information, method, split, gift, and other details.
	- c.  Payment particulars, both general methods and those on file for Sherry are shown. Use links to [Single use Credit Card], [Single use ..], etc.., when the order is being billed to an account not associated with the customer.
	- d.  Review the Order to Checkout, Final Review gives the customer the opportunity to review and confirm all details about the order.
	- e.  Submit the order, when the Submit button was selected, behind the scenes wheels were placed in motion, and the order is prepared to Accepted or Approved. Note the Order #WS10070 near the upper LH corner, that is the customer’s link to this order as well as your tracking number for processing through the Picking, Packing and Shipping processes.
