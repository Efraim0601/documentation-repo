  There are currently two ways to add a party to a billing account.

- Enter a party id in the 'Party Billed To' field
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- Use the 'Roles' sub menu to add a party id with the role of 'Bill To Customer'
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- If using the first method then when you press the update button this removes the party id from this field and automatically creates the party under the Roles sub menu with the role of 'Bill To Customer'
