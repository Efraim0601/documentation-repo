- Time periods are a defined period of time (usually a month, quarter or year) that is used to group business transactions. It is a key part of any general accounting setup.
- Time periods can be used for the definition of :
- <ul>
      <li>Company Financial Year</li>
      <li>Fiscal / Tax Periods (weeks, months, quarters)</li>
      <li>VAT / GST Periods</li>
      <li>Sales Periods</li>
  </ul>
- The screen is divided into 3 main areas. The first two show lists of the open and closed time periods. The area at the bottom allows you to define and enter a new time period.
