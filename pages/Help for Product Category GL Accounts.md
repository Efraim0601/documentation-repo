- The Product Category GL Account is used to specify the default account to be used for a specific 'Product Category' and 'Account Type' combination. This setup will translate to one side of the journal entry only.
- It is used for tracking product category transactions at a more detailed level.
- Examples could be as follows:
- <ul>
      <li>Tracking Accounts Receivable by Product Category in the General Ledger</li>
      <li>Tracking Cost of Goods by Product Category in the General Ledger</li>
      <li>Tracking Commissions paid by Product Category in the General Ledger</li>
  </ul>
- The demo data gives an idea of the use of product categories to classify or separate different products streams. If specific accounting or management reporting is required at this level then the General Ledger can be setup to provide this detail.
