- This sub menu allows terms to be associated with a billing account.
- Currently these can be the following:
- <ul><li>payment terms (discounted if paid within specified days)</li><li>payment terms (due on a specified day per month)</li><li>payment terms (net days)</li><li>penalty terms (late fee)</li><li>penalty terms (collection agency fee)</li><li>miscellaneous (non returnable sales item)</li></ul>
- #+BEGIN_NOTE
  TO CHECK: There is an overlap here with the terms that can be specified in an agreement. Would a billing account party also have an agreement for payment terms…​? .
