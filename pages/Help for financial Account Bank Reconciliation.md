- A specific GL account is normally used to represent the company bank account and any accounting transaction that involves the bank account will automatically record and entry in the GL.
- The bank reconciliation process ensures that the GL account and the bank statement reconcile to the same amounts.
- Differences can occur between the GL and the bank statement for a variety of valid reasons including the following:
	- <ul><li>Payments or Deposits in process (especially cheques)</li><li>Interest or Bank Charges that are not known in advance but are applied to the bank account</li><li>Currency or Exchange Rate variations / charges</li><li>Any outstanding</li></ul>

  The differences will occur because of timing differences of when and how transactions are recorded. Examples are as follows:
  1) Bank charges are known to the bank first and only once they have applied the charge to the bank account can the company duplicate the transaction in the GL to make the balance reconcile.
  2) A customer cheque payment may be recorded in the GL first before it is paid into the bank account
