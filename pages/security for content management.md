- All services defined in the content component are safely secured. If you are in a safe environment, want to save more complex contents and get blocked by the security policy you might want to override the security only in the content component.
  title:: security for content management
- Typically when using content/control/WebSiteCms?webSiteId=CmsSite (ie "Edit[ing] WebSite CMS For: CMS Web Site [CmsSite]"), the service updateTextContent may prevent you to save contents with a message like
- #+BEGIN_WARNING
  The Following Errors Occurred: In field [textData] by our input policy, your input has not been accepted for security reason. Please check and modify accordingly, thanks.
  #+END_WARNING
- To override the security you can change definitions of other content services by changing the security on field "textData" from "safe" to "any". Thatâ€™s of course an example and you may find other similar cases.
- You may also prefer to change the security policy at an upper level. See owasp.properties file.
