- An example of how to bring in an opening balance is shown below:
- Navigate to the the Financial Account Transactions sub menu
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- Select 'Adjustment' in the Fin Account Trans Type Id field
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- Leave the 'Party Id' field blank
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- Fill in the 'Transaction Date' field
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- Fill in the 'Entry Date' field (NOTE TO CHECK: Need to check exactly what this is - is it the date the transaction is entered or is it the date the transaction is processed?)
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- Fill in the 'Amount' field with the transaction amount (Eg. In our case this is the opening balance such as 353.88 - dont think we need the $ sign)
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- Leave the 'Payment Id' field blank
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- Leave the 'Order Id' field blank
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- Leave the 'Order Item Seq Id' field blank
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- Leave the 'Reason Enum Id' field blank (NOTE TO CHECK: This could be useful in identifying transactions to a greater level of detail…​.)
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- Fill in the 'Comments' field (Eg: Opening Balance from XYZ Statement)
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- Press the 'Add' button and the transaction will be displayed at the bottom of the screen
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- #+BEGIN_NOTE
