- MRP is a three-letter abbreviation that is always used in conjunction with manufacturing – so what exactly is it?
- MRP stands for “Material Requirement Planning”. It’s a computer program that, when run regularly, helps a business to plan what to manufacture and when to manufacture it.
- It also has the added benefit of letting you know when to buy raw materials to meet your manufacturing commitments.
- The MRP tool comes with APOGEE ‘out of the box’.
