- When a customer first enters the Ecommerce website, they are challenged for a Username and a Password. If they are first time visitors, they are provided an opportunity to create an account. If they have visited before, they are asked for their username and password. All of their entries are automatically logged into the APOGEE databases for your review in APOGEE and for their ordering processes. They never see any part of APOGEE except the Ecommerce interface which includes the content posted from APOGEE to the Ecommerce portion as called up by their preferences.
