- APOGEE is heavily inspired by a book called the "The Data Model Resource Book". This book provides a "A Library of Universal Data Models for All Enterprises". These models cover things like parties, orders, invoices, payments, general ledgers, quotes and much more.

- It is important to note that the data model library does not only cover entities, but also the data that comes with these entities. Data is further categorized by function (seed, demo, etc …​)
