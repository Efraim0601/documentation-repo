- Payments are transactions that received by or generated by a business.
- They can be incoming or outgoing.
- Incoming payments are normally from customers and outgoing ones to suppliers.
- the Payment screen contains a lot of information not normally at your fingertips. The screen for creating a Payment looks very similar to the View Payment screen: you have drop-down boxes for Payment Type, Payment Method Type, and Status. The other fields are asking for ID numbers which may be more difficult to obtain.
- For the above reasons, it is probably quicker and easier to click on the [Receive Payment] link from the View Order screen than to try to create a Payment from the Accounting Manager.
