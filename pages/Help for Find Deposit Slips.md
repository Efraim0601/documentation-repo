- This screen is used to locate payment groups and their associated deposit slips that have been created.
  Deposit slips are created by grouping transactions together into a Payment Group.
  This can be done using the 'Accounting / Payment Group' tab, the 'Financial Account / Deposit Withdraw' tab or the 'Create New Deposit Slip' button.
- Currently Deposit Slips are created for AR Batch Payments only.
- The deposit slips are available in PDF format and there is an option to cancel the batch that generated the deposit slip if required.
