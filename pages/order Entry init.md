- #### *Sales Order vs. Purchase Order*
  Disregard the Purchase Order section of this screen. That is only used when you (as a representative of your company) are ordering product or services from another vendor for your company’s use.
- #### *Product Store*
  It is probable that your CSR (Customer Service Representative) is processing orders for more than one 'Store' which could be an actual physical presence or a virtual shopping center seen on-line by the customer.
  Confirming the correct Store at this point is critical.
- #### *Sales Channel*
  How did this order reach you? Here are some possibilities:
- a. The customer is standing in front of you at your terminal, probably in an actual store front — POS Channel.
- b. The customer called in the order and you are on the phone with them at this time — phone channel.
- c. You are reading from a fax sheet, an e-mail printout, a letter or order form — FAX channel, e-mail channel, or snail mail channel, as appropriate.
- d. Some other party gathered one or more orders together and has forwarded a consolidated order to you — affiliate channel.
- e. You are not taking the order but it is being processed through the ecommerce website — defaults the category to web channel.
