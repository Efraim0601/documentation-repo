- Authorizations are not deleted they are instead expired.
  This means that the history of the authorizations will remain on the account as an audit trail.
- Example: To expire an authorisation
- Select the 'Authorizations' tab for the Financial Account
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- Any authorizations will be displayed at the bottom of the screen
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- If the authorization is still current the 'Thru Date' field will be blank
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
  (NOTE TO CHECK: May not always be true as you can specify a future date for it to expire…​…​!!!)
- Select the 'Expire' button next to the authorisation to be expired
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
-
- The authorization is removed from the financial account and the screen is redisplayed with the 'Thru Date' field completed
