- Updating the Chart of Accounts will involve either creating a new assignment or removing an existing one.
  A new assignment is created using the instructions above.
- The added complication may be that the account that you need does not exist in the Global Chart of Accounts. As mentioned above it will need to be created and then linked.
- See the instructions below to remove an existing account assignment.
- #+BEGIN_NOTE
  If a completely new account is required that does not already exist as part of the Global Chart of Accounts template then it will need to be created as part of the Global template first before it can be used as an assignment in the Organisation Chart of Accounts.
