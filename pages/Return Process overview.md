- Sales Return is merchandise returned back to the seller by a customer. Sales return is a common concept used in sales and purchase terminology. The main purpose of the sales return is to provide easy returns to the customers to maintain long relationships with them.
- While viewing an existing order, you can create a return from that order by clicking on the [Create Return] button (in Action section). That will take you to the quickreturn screen, from where you identify which item(s) the customers wants to return.
- A sales return can be created for one of the following Reasons:
- <ul><li>Excess quantity shipped</li><li>Excess quantity ordered</li><li>Defective Goods</li><li>Goods shipped too late</li><li>Product specifications are incorrect</li><li>Wrong items shipped</li></ul>

- Sales Return types can be:
- <ul><li>Store credit</li><li>Refund</li><li>Exchange</li><li>Store credit replacement</li>
  </ul>
- When a product is returned, the process impacts many different components of your business. Consider:
- Customer must coordinate the physical return of the item(s) with your company. This is controlled by the document called the 'Return'. Be sure the Customer encloses a copy of the Return with his package or at least includes the Return ID on the shipping label and documents.

- As you scroll through the screens, try to envision how each of these areas are impacted within the Company. Realize that the Order Manager, Work Effort Manager, Accounting Manager, and Facility Manager are primary players. The Marketing Manager and perhaps the Manufacturing Manager might be involved if some adjustments are needed.
- Fortunately, the systems set up within Open For Business have automated much of this for you. However, by understanding the entire process, you can better stay alert for steps that might be needed as returns come back to your company.
