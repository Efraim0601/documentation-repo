- The overall purpose of the Marketing application is the support to select leads from parties obtained from a certain source or marketing segment to convert to opportunities by contacting these parties via a contact-list related to a marketing campaign.
  (contact-list generation support not yet implemented)
- The marketing application is supporting you to create, select and follow sales opportunities in order to create sales orders for the company.
- The first option of the marketing application is the definition of a datasource [DataSource], and connecting or loading party information to it [PartyDataSource]. In the party application a data source Id can be added to the party.
- A second input to the marketing application is the Segment group and classification which again can be allocated to parties in the party component.
- Now a marketing campaign can be created. A contact list can be created using the parties related to a dataSource or marketing segment classification and referring back to the marketing campaign
- Contact lists are currently email mailinglists, the APOGEE system could be extended to include the support of calling by telephone and entering the results.
  On the email sent via this lists tracking codes can be used to measure the response when the readers of the email mailing click on a link where a trackingcode is specified.
- Opportunities resulting from these actions can be entered in the SFA web application referring back to the marketing campaign.
