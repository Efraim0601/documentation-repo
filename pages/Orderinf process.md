- you can:
- ### Choose catalog,
  your customer might be ordering from your Spring catalog, your Outdoor Specials catalog, or whatever electronic Catalog he may have come across online or through email. Establish or confirm the Catalog here so that details (including prices!) reflect the Catalog he has seen.
  You might need additional login programming to arrive at the correct catalog if the customer is referred here through internet solicitation and linkage; asking the customer to specify the catalog he saw in the ad is not always productive. The catalog specified here will govern what products, special offers, discounts, and other details of the marketing process are presented in this screen and for the order itself. All of your marketing efforts must be coordinated with the presentation now seen by the customer. Your default catalog needs to be broad enough to cover all the instances where a customer’s choices or the login protocol bring him to the default.
- ### Find Product,
  opportunities to select and order product abound on this screen. The customer can follow whichever path attracts his interest or matches his needs. Those sections of the screen are each discussed below, not necessarily in order of appearance.
	- #### *Featured Products*,
	  the center of the screen is a list of all or most of the products under the heading of Featured Products. These can include a photo, description, price, promotional information, discounts, links to the catalog page, link from Virtual products to their variations, place to specify quantity being ordered and the most important link: [Add To Cart]. If more than one page of products is needed, scrolling links are given.
	  This section of the page is replaced by other functions when in use, such as search engines, category lists, etc. The customer can always return to this portion of the screen by clicking on the Main link on the upper Menu bar.
		- *Additional information*
		  Clicking on the product name either here or anywhere in the screen will bring up the product detail screen.
		  Every product name is hotkey to this information which drops into the center of the screen. You can establish what information will appear for each of your feature products.
	- #### *Last Products*,
	  Shows the product which the customer has looked at more closely by clicking on the product name; cumulative until [Clear] is pressed.
	- #### *Quick Reorder*,
	  Items from previous orders are listed here with a link to add them to this order in the same quantity as before.
		- *Why offer re-order ?*
		  Previously ordered items are displayed here. Studies have indicated that repeat customers are like gold. By presenting them with reminders of their previous purchases, you are both flattering them and providing an opportunity for another purchase of the same items.
		  This section also saves the customer from having to lookup the items she previously ordered. All are presented here.
		  Doesn’t this make the Shopping List concept unnecessary? Not really, because the Shopping Lists can carry 'Wish Lists' as well as previously ordered items. Also, Shopping Lists can be plugged into the order 'en masse' rather than item by item. There could be dozens of different Lists, each tailor-designed for a specific purpose.
		  For regular, heavy-hitter customers, you might want to limit the list of previously-ordered items to only the most recent 10 or so.
	- #### *Browse Categories*,
	  Categories are collections of related items. If the customer is looking for Books, for example, this would quickly get him to that portion of the inventory with presentations of Book titles or sub-catgories from which to choose.
	  Another way to consider this section: whereas the initial screen might show all the products (with scrolling), the Category selection will eliminate all products displayed except those in the Category he has chosen.
	- #### *Search in Category*,
	  A click on [Advanced Search] to have a dedicated search sub-screen
	  When the [Search In Category] link is selected, a simple but powerful search tool opens in the center screen. By making a few choices and entering a keyword or two, the customer can look for products that exist in the Featured Products category.
	  After a successful find, the customer is presented with a second screen, titled productFound. Here she has a couple of choices. If the returns are too extensive, she could refine the search. If she sees what she wants, a quick click on [Add To Cart] will select the product in whatever quantity she enters.
	- #### *Last Categories*,
	  As the Customer browses around the screen, looking into various products, categories, or other content, this section is constantly updated with links back to previously-viewed screens. Therefore, he will be able to quickly return to something that has stayed in his memory.
	- #### *Browse Content*,
	  Brings up a powerful tool for searching Content which could be documents, case studies, test results, testimonials, additional graphics, specifications, or whatever Content you choose to have accessible to the customer.
	- #### *Search Catalog*,
	  Entering a term in the search Catalog field resulted in a Product Search screen with some results.
	  Customers will use this to search the catalog by keywords, such as the name of the product or one of its features. You can help their search by keeping the Thesaurus updated.
