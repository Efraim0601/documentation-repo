- Promotions are similar to Price Rules (see Price Rules, below) but are used to record special promotional offers which apply to the entire order, rather than prices for a particular product.
- For example, the promotional manager can be used to set up rules to give customers a percentage discount if they purchase a minimum quantity, or to create a coupon code.
- #+BEGIN_IMPORTANT
  Promotions are tied to specific stores, whereas price rules are applicable to all products
  (although you can specify the website, product catalog, or category for which a price rule is applicable).
