- A product store has all the information needed to sell products.
- It is composed of a series of catalogs, which are composed of product categories and products.
- Each store can have its own shipping, fulfillment, notification, promotions, payment processing, and tax calculation policies.
- A product store can point to several different websites, allowing the same products to be sold on multiple hosted sites or domains.
  Alternatively, multiple stores, each with their own website, can be set up to allow different pricing and fulfillment procedures for, say, different countries or different market segments (wholesale versus retail.)
