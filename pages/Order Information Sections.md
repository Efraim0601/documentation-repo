### Order Information Sections
- #### *Status and General Info*
- Notice the Status History? This tells you when the order was placed, when it was approved and, later, where it is at in the shipping process.
- The section labeled 'Created by' will give you the login ID of the person taking or making the order. This is who you need to talk with if there are any problems in the original order. Remember, it could be your customer service rep or it could be the customer herself if the order came in through ecommerce.
-
- #### *Payment Information Section*
  This section will reflect the type of payment selected by the customer. If Debit or Credit Card, the card number last 4 digits will show; if EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer - electronic checking withdrawal), the bank account number will appear.
- Shipment of the order against customer payment by check or money order will appear as shown below. It might be your practice to withhold shipment until payment is received. When it arrives, pull up the order and click on [Receive Payment].
- #### *Order Items Section*
  All the products, whether ordered or being sent as promos, are listed here. Note the many details shown in this section.

- #### *Shipment Information Section*
  Steps for shipping the order start here.
- Remember there are two different uses of the word 'Splitting' and you need to know which meaning is being used. When the phrase 'Splitting Preferences' is used here we mean: Does the customer want a part of his order to be shipped as soon as any portion is available, allowing the delayed balance to follow at a later date? If splitting is not desired, all elements of the order must be gathered together for a unified shipment.
- In this order as shown, if you were to click on the link [Allow Split], you would reverse the customer’s original choice to wait for all items in one order. Do NOT select that link unless the customer has informed you of a change in her former preference!
- When the next item is considered, 'Ship Group,' we would be looking at a Split Order with part of it going to one destination and the other part to another if there were two Ship Groups indicated. As the order in this example shows only one Ship Group, you can know that all items are destined for the same location.
- The **[Pack Shipment For Ship Group]** button Initiates the preparation of packages for shipping the order under the Facility Manager. This is just one of many screens where this step can be triggered.
- There are several approaches to having the products Picked and Packed in the system. One method is to open the Facility Manager, click on the Facilities tab, select your Facility, then click on the Picking tab.
  After identifying and submitting orders that need Picking to the floor, you move over to the Packing tab. This one is more individualized; you can see the screen shot below. You must enter the Order number, then enter the Product ID for each item as it is accepted.
  A much easier method is right there in the Order Manager. Pull up the Order and look under Shipment Information. See the link labeled Pack Shipment For Ship Group [00001]? Click on that and you will see the second screen below.
- The link **[New Shipment for Ship Group {00001}]** will bring up a working screen in the Facility Manager to allow you to begin the Warehouse Path, discussed below.
