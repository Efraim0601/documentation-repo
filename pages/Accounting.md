- The APOGEE accounting system is a core application component and has most of the modern features you would expect in a general purpose double-entry accounting system. However, APOGEE goes beyond that by and seamlessly integrates with other APOGEE applications such as Inventory, Purchasing and Manufacturing to give your business a complete ERP solution. This makes the system as a whole robust and integrated to provide more value than a plain accounting system.
