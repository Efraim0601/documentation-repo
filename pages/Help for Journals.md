  By default in APOGEE a journal called 'ERROR_JOURNAL' is created as part of the demo data installation.
  This 'ERROR_JOURNAL' is referenced in the Accounting Preferences setup for 'Company'.
  The 'ERROR_JOURNAL' is used to store details of any transaction that fails and cannot be posted to a general ledger account.
  Transactions falling into error can be as the result of incomplete setup or an invalid transaction (eg a transaction that should never occur).
