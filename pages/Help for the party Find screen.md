- ### From Party to Order
- This screen can be a starting point for Order management (view existing, create a new one, …​).
- For each Parties listed, there are links to Order management action.
- Before taking the order, you might want to update the party’s information: is the address and phone number current, how will they be paying for the order (credit card number current? EFT information correct?), or perhaps review their ordering history (are there an excessive number of returns?). To look at their file, either click on the [Party ID] or the [Details] link.
- If the contact from your customer is specifically about a previous order, you can click on the [[Orders]] link which will take you to a table of all their previous orders.
