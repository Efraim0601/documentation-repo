  1) In GL Account Defaults there is a specific tab 'FinAccount Type Gl Account' for specifying which type of Financial accounts are posted to which general ledger account.
  2) In GL Account Defaults there is also a tab 'Payment Method Id / GL Account ID' for specifying the account to post transactions to if 'Financial Account' is selected as the Payment Method instead of (Cash, Cheque, Credit Card, etc). By default the demo setup posts transactions to 111100 GENERAL CHECKING ACCOUNT.
