- QuickShip presumes sevral things:
- <ol><li>That inventory is on hand and ready to be shipped or taken from the premises by the purchaser.</li><li>That third parties, such a shipping company, a warehouseman, a picker, etc., are not needed to fulfill the order.</li><li>That the method of payment is acceptable: that the customer has paid or that credit has been extended for payment to be received later.</li></ol>
- Essentially, QuickShip allows APOGEE to bypass all of the procedures for identifying, picking, packing, billing and shipping so that the package is immediately dispatched.
- <ol>  <li>Click on 'Quick-Ship Entire Order'</li><li>Confirm Quick-Ship Success</li></ol>

- Shipments affords two links:
- <ul>
    <li>#[10050] → Facility Manager > Shipments tab > View Shipment document 10050.</li><li>[Packing Slip] generates a PDF document for including with the order as a Packing Slip.</li>
  </ul>
- *[Quick-Refund Entire Order]* link could be used to immediately reverse a completed order which had been charged to a Credit Card, an Electronics Fund Transfer (EFT), or a Gift Card. Best used before the items leave the Facility. If already shipped, use the [Create Return] link.
- *[Create Return]* brings up a working screen to begin the complex process of bringing products from the customer back into your facility, reversing charges, etc.
- *The Quick-Ship Shipment document*
  Even though the 'Shipment' did not follow a complete course through the Facility Manager and elsewhere, paperwork is still needed to confirm stock deletions and track where products have gone.
- You can see the highlighted 'Shipments #' link. Click on that number to see the details as shown immediately below.
- *View Shipment Details*
  In so much as shipping methods were specified in the ordering process (UPS Ground), this example is somewhat skewed. If you knew the customer was going to retrieve the products personally, you would so indicate in the original order entry process.
- You will notice in the document that inventory adjustments and other issues are all presented. You can bore down into any of the highlighted links or select one of the sub-tabs to bring up further details about the order, the products, the customer, etc.
- A final link to follow is the 'Generate Shipment Manifest Report' which produces a PDF form to send with the purchaser or to serve as a hard copy for your internal purposes. An example is given below.
