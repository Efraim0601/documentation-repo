- The Variance Reason / GL Account default is used for mapping any stock differences to a particular general ledger account. If there are variances in the number of products that are in stock then this affects the value of inventory in the general ledger. By using this GL default you can offset any differences in stock to the relevant general ledger account.
- The number of products (or items) in stock can vary.
  These differences can be caused by numerous reasons.
  Some of these could be as follows:
- <ul>
      <li>Products have been damaged</li>
      <li>Products were lost or stolen</li>
      <li>Products were found</li>
      <li>Under or over supply of a Product from a Supplier (e.g., You have ordered 10 and 11 are delivered…​)</li>
      <li>Free samples or giveaways to potential clients</li>
  </ul>
