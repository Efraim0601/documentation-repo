- An “agreement” is a way of recording a business arrangement or contract that your business makes with other companies or individuals. Some common examples of agreements include Payment Terms (where you allow a customer up to 30 days to pay you) or Prompt Payment Discounts (where you offer a reduction on the amount owing if your customer pays you before a certain date)
