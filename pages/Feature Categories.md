- Click on [Feature Categories] (this is the default screen when you clicked on 'Features' above), and you will see a menu for editing a particular feature, if you remember its feature ID.
  (If not, you can edit it from the feature categories below.) Next, you will see a list of feature categories and their parent categories.
- The categories' ID codes are highlighted, and you can click on one to go to the feature category.
- At the very bottom is a menu for creating a new feature category.
  Here, you would enter the new feature categoryâ€™s name and specify a parent category for it (if it has one.) The category ID is automatically created for you.
