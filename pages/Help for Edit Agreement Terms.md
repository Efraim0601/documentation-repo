- Examples of agreement terms from a sales and purchase viewpoint include the following:
- <ul><li>Payment due within a certain timeframe (e.g., 30 days)</li><li>Discounts for early payment</li><li>Specifying Late fee penalties</li><li>Purchasing agreements</li><li>Specifying commission rates</li><li>Exclusive Relationship</li></ul>

  Agreements can also be specified for Employment, Legal, Non Compete etc.
  #+END_NOTE
- Agreement terms are configured by linking them to the Invoice Item Type.

  The drop down box for 'Invoice Item Type' contains what appears to be duplicates for items such as 'Invoice Fee', 'Invoice Discount', 'Invoice Finished Good Item' etc.
  These are NOT duplicates
  - one of these entries refers to the Sales Invoice
  - and the other refers to the Purchase Invoice.
  As the descriptions are exactly the same it is impossible to know which refers to which so needs to be done using trial and error!
