- This screen is used to input or 'capture' a payment against a Sales Order.
- Unlike the authorise, this function will actually deduct the amount from eg a credit card and apply the payment to a specific order.
- It is likely that the before the payment is 'captured' in this screen, it would have been through an authorisation first.
