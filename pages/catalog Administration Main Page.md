- The catalog administration main page has several small menus for finding catalogs, categories, or products.
- The first three menus allow you to edit catalogs, categories, or products by their respective IDs, or create new catalogs, categories, or products.
  The last one allows you to look for a product using an ID other than its product ID, such as upc or isbn number (see below.)
  Under these menus are two more links.
- [[Auto create keywords]]
- [[Fast load catalog into cache.]]
