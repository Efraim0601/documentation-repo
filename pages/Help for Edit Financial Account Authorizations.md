- An authorization is a temporary transaction showing a commitment to take money from a financial account. It is like a 'transaction in progress' where there can be delay between when you buy something and the time it actually appears on your statement.
- Authorizations can be time limit specific meaning that they can be controlled by entering a start and end date so that they are only valid for a certain length of time.
  They can also be expired.
  When an authorization is expired it removes the commitment from the financial account.
  The history of expired authorizations are shown on the financial account.
