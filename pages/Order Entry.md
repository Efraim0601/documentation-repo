- In this screen you can create a Sales order on the first part, or a Purchase Order on the second part.
- For Purchase Order entry, all parties with role "SUPPLIER" are listed in the drop down supplier.
- Using the top portion labeled Sales Order, identify the Party placing the order, either with their User Login Id or Party Id. The search tool can be a help.
  You have several means to reach the PartyID for the person or company which wishes to place an order.
- <ol>
      <li>Enter the PartyID or LoginID directly if either of those are known.</li>   <li>OR Enter the known information, such as name in the search fields; the return will appear in the table as shown below.</li>  <li>OR click on the link to the Popup search tool to the right of the User Login and Party ID box in the Sales Order section; and you have a search tool where you can either scroll the listing of known Parties or enter the information you might have and let the search find the party for you.</li>
  </ol>
- If specifics about the order are not known, you might prefer to find it through the Party. In that case, select [Lookup Party]. The Party Manager can link you back to previous orders.
- Basically, you cannot place an order until the Party is identified. There are several ways to establish the Party ID from within the Order Manager. Since several of those ways take you back through the Party Manager, it might be just as easy to begin with the Party Manager.
